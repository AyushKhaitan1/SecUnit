# AI-Powered Campus Safety & Security Monitoring

## üö® Problem Statement

Campus safety is a critical concern for students, parents, and administrators. Traditional reporting methods are slow and inefficient, and security teams often lack real-time information about emergencies or unusual activities. There is a need for a fast, interactive, and intelligent system to empower students and enable proactive campus security.

## üöß Current Progress Status

- ‚úÖ Chatbot UI and logic for emergency reporting, SOS, and FAQs (Completed)
- ‚úÖ AI surveillance script for motion/unusual activity detection (Completed)
- ‚è≥ Integration between chatbot and backend (Pending)
- ‚è≥ Admin dashboard for real-time alerts (Basic prototype pending)
- ‚è≥ Full deployment and advanced AI models (Pending)

## üí° How Our Prototype Solves the Problem

- **For Students:** A web-based chatbot allows instant reporting of emergencies, sending SOS alerts (with location/ID), and getting safety information.
- **For Security/Admins:** AI surveillance analyzes CCTV feeds for unusual activities and triggers alerts. All reports and alerts can be viewed in a dashboard, enabling faster and more effective responses.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies/Tools Used

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **AI/Surveillance:** Python, OpenCV
- **Backend (for future integration):** Python (Flask)
- **Version Control:** GitHub
